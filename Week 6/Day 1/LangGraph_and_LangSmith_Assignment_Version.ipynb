        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Some significant improvements that the LoRa system makes include:\\n\\n1. Long Range Communication: LoRa technology allows for long-range communication of up to several kilometers in urban environments and even more in rural areas. This makes it ideal for applications that require long-range connectivity, such as smart cities, agriculture, and industrial IoT.\\n\\n2. Low Power Consumption: One of the key advantages of LoRa is its low power consumption, which enables devices to operate on battery power for extended periods. This is particularly important for IoT devices that are deployed in remote locations or areas where power sources are limited.\\n\\n3. Scalability: The LoRa system is highly scalable, allowing for the deployment of thousands of devices within a single network. This scalability makes it suitable for large-scale IoT deployments in smart cities, industrial settings, and other applications.\\n\\n4. Cost-Effective: LoRa technology is cost-effective compared to other wireless communication technologies, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to deploy IoT solutions on a budget.\\n\\n5. Interference Immunity: LoRa operates in the unlicensed ISM bands, which helps reduce interference from other wireless technologies. This ensures reliable communication even in crowded radio frequency environments.\\n\\n6. Flexibility: The LoRa system offers flexibility in terms of data rates, modulation schemes, and frequency bands, allowing for customization based on the specific requirements of the application.\\n\\nOverall, the LoRa system's significant improvements in long-range communication, low power consumption, scalability, cost-effectiveness, interference immunity, and flexibility make it a popular choice for a wide range of IoT applications.\",\n",

            "Tool Response: The attention mechanism is a technique used in machine learning and natural language processing to increase model accuracy by focusing on relevant data. It enables the model to focus on certain areas of the input data, giving more weight to crucial features and disregarding unimportant ones. The Machine learning-based attention method simulates how human attention works by assigning varying levels of importance to different words in a sentence. It assigns importance to each word by calculating \"soft\" weights for the word's numerical representation, known as its embedding, within a specific section of the sentence called the context window to determine its importance.

The concept of \"attention\" in deep learning has its roots in the effort to improve Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for handling longer sequences or sentences.
